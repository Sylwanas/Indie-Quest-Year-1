eventNarration: You manage to make your way over to the main doors and as you very sneakily open them they creak quite loud, but you’re sure no one heard that. An excessively ornate throne made out of gold with precious gems adorning it sits at the end opposite of the main doors. Long great tables for feasting sit in the middle of the hall and in the corner is a surprisingly tasteful candelabra. There appears to be only one guard here, standing in the hallway to what looks like the kitchens. Seeming quite busy talking to one of the servant girls. Other than the door to the north leading to the kitchens, there is a smaller door tor your right ahead leading to the unknown. What would you like to do?

Opening the door and slipping in you find yourself in a stairway leading up. Quickly following it you arrive in a wondrous bedroom, with silken sheets, wool pillows and a finely carved bed frame. Where you just came from the stairway continues upward, and to your left there is an unremarkable door. The carpet is unstained and soft, it feels amazing against your bare feet.

As you look up again you see him reach for something behind him, the glint of metal reflects towards you and in your anger you leap at him with the dagger. Before he is able to pull anything forward you are already on him. By the time you are done the blood drips from your hands. You can hear guards running up the stairs as you pick up the king's crown.
